## 🚀 Overview

This project is a **proof-of-concept (PoC)** for an **AI-driven credit assessment solution** that moves beyond legacy credit scoring. Instead of relying solely on repayment history, it integrates **multi-dimensional data sources** such as:

* 📈 **Financial Behavior** → Transactions, income patterns, savings, debts
* 👩‍💼 **Career & Industry** → Salary progression, job stability, industry volatility, employment gaps
* 🏠 **Housing & Assets** → Home ownership, rental stability, loan-to-asset ratios
* 🌏 **Macroeconomic & Job Market Data** → Industry demand, regional employment trends
* 👥 **Social & Lifestyle Indicators** → Spending behavior, responsible community engagement (non-invasive, opt-in)
* 💳 **Traditional Credit Data** → Credit utilization, repayment history, limits

The goal: **fairer, explainable, and future-proof creditworthiness evaluations** while minimizing bias.

 The system is designed to be:

* **Accurate** → Powered by AI models trained on structured & unstructured data.
* **Explainable** → Every score comes with clear reasoning and contributing factors.
* **Scalable** → Built on modern, modular architecture with extensibility in mind.
* **Realistic** → Takes into account real-life dynamics such as career stability, housing ownership, and market conditions.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Creditworthiness Engine (AI-Driven)**

  * Combines income, debt, repayment history, spending patterns, and financial ratios.
  * Adjusts dynamically based on **career trajectory, industry health, and job stability**.
  * Incorporates **housing ownership status**, local property market conditions, and mortgage exposure.
  * Optionally integrates **social/economic indicators** for more holistic risk profiling.

* **Scenario Simulation ("What-If" Engine)**

  * Users can simulate life events (e.g., job change, salary bump, house purchase, market downturn).
  * Instantly see how such events impact their credit rating.

* **Transparent AI Insights**

  * Uses explainable AI (XAI) to show **why** a score was assigned.
  * Provides breakdown: “Career +5 pts, Debt -15 pts, Housing +10 pts, Job Market -5 pts.”

* **Frontend (React + ServiceBench Webkit)**

  * Built with **React** for speed and flexibility.
  * Uses **ServiceBench Webkit** for pre-styled, professional-grade components.
  * Provides dashboards, interactive charts, simulation inputs, and report views.

* **Backend (FastAPI + SQLite3 + AI Models)**

  * FastAPI for REST API endpoints and business logic.
  * SQLite3 (upgradeable to PostgreSQL) for data storage.
  * AI models (scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch) for credit scoring & simulations.

* **Test Data & Virtualization Layer**

  * Swagger-based service mocking for endpoints.
  * Synthetic test data generation for demo purposes.
  * Prompt-based test data augmentation.

* **Future Expansion**

  * Integration with real financial APIs (e.g., Plaid).
  * Career & job market APIs (LinkedIn, labor market data).
  * Housing/property market feeds.
  * Advanced AI explainability dashboards.
