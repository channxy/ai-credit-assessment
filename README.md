## 📋 Overview

This project is a next-generation AI-powered credit assessment platform that goes beyond traditional credit scoring. Instead of relying solely on bank transactions or bureau scores, it integrates career trajectory, salary history, industry outlook, housing status, and even social/economic signals into a more dynamic, explainable, and fair model.

### 🎯 Mission

- **Provide better, fairer credit scoring**
- **Enhance lending decisions**
- **Give users transparency & recommendations** to improve their financial health

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔍 Core Credit Features

- **Transaction History**: Traditional income & spending analysis
- **Repayment Behavior**: Existing loans, credit card repayment patterns
- **Asset & Liability Tracking**: Comprehensive financial overview

### 🏡 Lifestyle & Economic Signals

- **Career Path & Salary Progression**: Uses job role, industry, and income trajectory to predict stability
- **Industry Outlook**: AI integrates labor market data (job demand, layoffs, growth trends)
- **Housing Ownership**: Renting vs buying vs mortgaged — big impact on credit risk
- **Job Market Dynamics**: Uses macro data (unemployment rate, hiring trends)

### 🌐 Social & Alternative Data

- **Utility & Phone Bills**: Consistent small repayments improve score
- **Social Signals** (POC mode): Public LinkedIn data, professional reputation signals, network strength
- **Education Background**: Degree field, institution, job-skill alignment

### 🤖 AI-Powered Intelligence

- **Risk Prediction Model**: Classifies creditworthiness (Good / Risky)
- **Explainable AI**: SHAP values or LIME to show why a decision was made
- **Recommendation Engine**: Personalized advice (e.g., "Your industry outlook is declining, consider upskilling" / "Improve repayment consistency to unlock better scores")

### 📊 User Experience

- **Interactive Dashboard**: Users view their score breakdown
- **Scenario Simulation**: "What if I buy a house?" / "What if I change job sectors?"
- **Career-Credit Link**: Unique angle → shows how career choices affect financial health

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Frontend (UI)
- **React / Next.js dashboard**
- **Visualizations**: credit score, factors, career projections

### Backend (API)
- **FastAPI** serving endpoints:
  - `/predict` → Runs credit risk model
  - `/simulate` → Runs scenario analysis
  - `/recommend` → Personalized financial advice

### Database
- **SQLite / Postgres** for POC
- **Tables**: users, transactions, career, housing, social_data

### AI Models
- **Credit Risk Model**: XGBoost / LightGBM trained on synthetic + public data
- **Career Trajectory Model**: ML model forecasting income/job risk
- **Explainability Layer**: SHAP for transparency

### Data Sources (for POC, mock or public datasets)
- **Kaggle credit datasets**
- **Public labor market APIs** (World Bank, LinkedIn Economic Graph, govt stats)
- **Synthetic user career/housing datasets**
