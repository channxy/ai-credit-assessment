## 🚀 Overview

This project is a **proof-of-concept (PoC)** for an **AI-driven credit assessment solution** that moves beyond legacy credit scoring. Instead of relying solely on repayment history, it integrates **multi-dimensional data sources** such as:

* 📈 **Financial Behavior** → Transactions, income patterns, savings, debts
* 👩‍💼 **Career & Industry** → Salary progression, job stability, industry volatility, employment gaps
* 🏠 **Housing & Assets** → Home ownership, rental stability, loan-to-asset ratios
* 🌏 **Macroeconomic & Job Market Data** → Industry demand, regional employment trends
* 👥 **Social & Lifestyle Indicators** → Spending behavior, responsible community engagement (non-invasive, opt-in)
* 💳 **Traditional Credit Data** → Credit utilization, repayment history, limits

The goal: **fairer, explainable, and future-proof creditworthiness evaluations** while minimizing bias.

## ✨ Key Features

* 🔮 **AI Credit Scoring Engine** → Uses machine learning (e.g., XGBoost, LLMs for unstructured data)
* 🧠 **Explainability Layer (XAI)** → Transparent reasons behind each score
* ⚡ **Real-Time Simulation** → “What-if” scenarios for career change, salary increase, home purchase, etc.
* 🏗️ **Virtual Data Services** → Synthetic + anonymized real-world datasets for testing (via your **service virtualization & TDM engine**)
* 🔐 **Secure & Compliant** → GDPR/PDPA ready, with consent-driven data handling
* 📊 **Analytics Dashboard** → For banks, fintechs, and regulators
* 🖥️ **Frontend Development** → Built using **Service Bench WebKit** for rapid prototyping & UI testing

Do you want me to also **write a version with “step-by-step build commands” (like a setup guide for Cursor to auto-generate the entire code)**, or keep this README as a high-level product & dev doc?
